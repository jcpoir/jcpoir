I am a Data Scientist with experience in natural language processing, deep learning, software engineering, and web systems. 

I enjoy taking on projects in areas of personal interest. Some favorites include predicting the sentiment (valence, energy, danceability) of classical piano music, detecting sarcasm in Reddit comments, and determining the relative efficiency of NFL players via Monte Carlo simulation.
