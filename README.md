Hi all â€”

I am a data scientist with experience in natural language processing, deep learning, software engineering, and web systems. 

I started my career in data science in 2021 as a master's student at the University of Pennsylvania. Since graduating, I've worked to deliver machine learning solutions for a range of government clients including the Army, the Air Force, and USAID. I enjoy taking on projects in areas of personal interest. Some favorites include:

  i. predicting the sentiment of classical piano music using LSTMs ðŸŽ¶
  
  ii. detecting sarcasm in Reddit comments ðŸ’»
  
  iii. building a distributed webserver, web crawler, and search engine ðŸ“ˆ
  

Since May, I've been working on-and-off on an end-to-end pipeline that will determine the relative efficiencies of NFL players and teams and use them to make predictions about future performance. So far, both matchup predictions and fantasy projections have been slightly more accurate on average than those provided by ESPN. View my project here: http://nfl-prophet.com.
