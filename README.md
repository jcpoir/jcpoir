Hi all ðŸ«¡

I am a Data Scientist with experience in natural language processing, deep learning, software engineering, and web systems. 

I started my career in data science in 2021 as a master's student at the University of Pennsylvania. Since graduating, I've worked to deliver machine learning solutions for a range of government clients including the Army, the Air Force, and USAID. I enjoy taking on projects in areas of personal interest. Some favorites include predicting the sentiment of classical piano music, detecting sarcasm in Reddit comments, and determining the relative efficiency of NFL players via Monte Carlo simulation.
